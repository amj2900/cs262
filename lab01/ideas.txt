Exercise 1.1


Create a system for incoming students unfamiliar with the campus that can draw
a path on a map for them or tell them where buildings are. Basically creating a 
more optimized map for Calvin's campus.

An optimized system for Calvin that makes it easier to find out if professors have
office hours or a professor can mark if they are available for assistance 
and could update their office hours if necessary.
