As you've likely noticed, I'm not a CS major. I'm a computer engineering major that's
minoring in CS. So my coding experience will likely be the least of my group, 
however, my experience working on the programming team for mars rover
has helped me develop better team work and communication skills so I
can easily adapt to new concepts.
